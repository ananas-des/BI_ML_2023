# Homework2 :zap:

## Linear Regression. Gradient descend

For **Homework2** we tried to implement **Linear regression** machine learning algorithms using custom fuctions for regression and binary classification, and using `sklearn` Python package. This task were coded with basic Python and `pandas` package. For data visualization, VIF and QQ-plot creation we used `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels` packages.

During this Homework we were dealing with:

- linear regression - dataset on california housing from `sklear` package to predict house prices via their features;
- binary classification - dataset on [pokemons](./data/Pokemon.csv) and the features to predict their Legendarity

For models qualoty evaluation, we used metrics that are used in *regression* ($R^2$, MSE, and MAE) and *classification* (precision, recall, f1, and accuracy). Also we calculated ROC AUC score and built confusion matrix for binary classification.
