## Homework1. *k*-Nearest Neighbors Method

For **Homework1** we tried to implement ***k*-Nearest Neighbors** machine learning algorithm using custom fuctions for classification and model metrics, and comparing their performance with respective functions from `sklearn` Python package. This task were coded with basic Python and `pandas` package. For data visualization we used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` packages.
